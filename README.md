## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Got More comfortable with Flexbox and learning how you can use it to create cleaner looking websites.
Learning how to making a faded circle was also huge problem but with trial and error got it to work

```html
<p class="reaction">
        <span class="reaction-content">
      <img src="assets/images/icon-reaction.svg">
      <span>Reaction</span>
        </span>
  80 / 100
</p>
```
```css
.grade-circle::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(75, 50, 203, 0), #4B32CB);
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

Continue focus on using Flexbox more effectively and learning to clean us CSS to be more digestible
